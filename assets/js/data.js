    abstract: `Deep sequence models are said to store atomic facts predominantly in the form of associative memory: a brute-force lookup of co-occurring entities. We identify a dramatically different form of storage of atomic facts that we term as geometric memory. Here, the model has synthesized embeddings encoding novel global relationships between all entities, including ones that do not co-occur in training. Such storage is powerful: for instance, we show how it transforms a hard reasoning task involving an ℓ-fold composition into an easy-to-learn 1-step navigation task.

From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry, as against a lookup of local associations, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical supervisory, architectural, or optimizational pressures. Counterintuitively, a geometry is learned even when it is more complex than the brute-force lookup.

Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that — in contrast to prevailing theories — indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also points out to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery, and unlearning.`,

    abstract: `LLM agents will increasingly act in socially structured settings where role, audience, and relational context can shape what is advantageous or costly to say. We study whether such social structure, without any explicit objective in the prompt, changes what an agent expresses publicly relative to an off-the-record (OTR) channel elicited under the same condition. We introduce a dual-channel debate framework in which agents produce public utterances that enter the shared history alongside OTR responses that are recorded but never shown to the other participant. Across 10 models, 3 scenarios, and 5 variations within each scenario, alignment-inducing settings produce systematic public-OTR divergence in the targeted agent, with its decision divergence rising from a ∼3% baseline to roughly 40%. The effect is consistent across four aggregate analyses: stance, semantic similarity, natural language inference, and survey responses. In some cases, the OTR response explicitly attributes public accommodation to relational pressures, such as career risk or sponsorship obligation. The findings suggest that agent evaluation should extend beyond explicit goals and detect emergent objectives. We present a dual-channel evaluation framework and complementary behavioral measures that operationalize this assessment.`,

    abstract: `Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e., timestamped after the encounter. Complementary structured data streams become available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the PubMed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it to PMOA and timeline annotations from i2b2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings (event match rates: GPT-5–0.93, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct–0.76) and strong temporal ordering (concordance: GPT-5–0.965, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct–0.908). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via multimodal integration.`,

    abstract: `Reconstructing precise clinical timelines is essential for modeling patient trajectories and forecasting risk in complex, heterogeneous conditions like sepsis. While unstructured clinical narratives offer semantically rich and contextually complete descriptions of a patient's course, they often lack temporal precision and contain ambiguous event timing. Conversely, structured electronic health record (EHR) data provides precise temporal anchors but misses a substantial portion of clinically meaningful events. We introduce a retrieval-augmented multimodal alignment framework that bridges this gap to improve the temporal precision of absolute clinical timelines extracted from text. Our approach formulates timeline reconstruction as a graph-based multistep process: it first extracts central anchor events from narratives to build an initial temporal scaffold, places non-central events relative to this backbone, and then calibrates the timeline using retrieved structured EHR rows as external temporal evidence. Evaluated using instruction-tuned large language models on the i2m4 benchmark spanning MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, our multimodal pipeline consistently improves absolute timestamp accuracy (AULTC) and improves temporal concordance across nearly all evaluated models over unimodal text-only reconstruction, without compromising event match rates. Furthermore, our empirical gap analysis reveals that 34.8% of text-derived events are entirely absent from tabular records, demonstrating that aligning these modalities can produce a more temporally faithful and clinically informative reconstruction of patient trajectories than either source alone.`,

    abstract: `Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) from right-censored survival data is critical in high-stakes applications such as precision medicine and individualized policy-making. Yet, the survival analysis setting poses unique challenges for HTE estimation due to censoring, unobserved counterfactuals, and complex identification assumptions. Despite recent advances, from causal survival forests to survival meta-learners and outcome imputation approaches, evaluation practices remain fragmented and inconsistent. We introduce SurvHTE‐Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for HTE estimation with censored outcomes. The benchmark spans (i) a modular suite of synthetic datasets with known ground truth, systematically varying causal assumptions and survival dynamics, (ii) semi-synthetic datasets that pair real-world covariates with simulated treatments and outcomes, and (iii) real-world datasets from a twin study (with known ground truth) and from an HIV clinical trial. Across synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world settings, we provide the first rigorous comparison of survival HTE methods under diverse conditions and realistic assumption violations. SurvHTE‐Bench establishes a foundation for fair, reproducible, and extensible evaluation of causal survival methods.`,

    abstract: `Clinical case reports encode rich, temporal patient trajectories that are often underexploited by traditional machine learning methods relying on structured data. In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings — extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline — serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.`,

We present PMOA-TTS, the first openly available dataset of 124,699 PubMed Open Access (PMOA) case reports, each converted into structured (event, time) timelines via a scalable LLM-based pipeline. Our approach combines heuristic filtering with Llama 3.3 to identify single-patient case reports, followed by prompt-driven extraction using Llama 3.3 and DeepSeek R1, resulting in over 5.6 million timestamped clinical events. To assess timeline quality, we evaluate against a clinician-curated reference set using three metrics: (i) event-level matching (80% match at a cosine similarity threshold of 0.1), (ii) temporal concordance (c-index > 0.90), and (iii) Area Under the Log-Time CDF (AULTC) for timestamp alignment. Corpus-level analysis shows wide diagnostic and demographic coverage. In a downstream survival prediction task, embeddings from extracted timelines achieve time-dependent concordance indices up to 0.82 ± 0.01, demonstrating the predictive value of temporally structured narratives. PMOA-TTS provides a scalable foundation for timeline extraction, temporal reasoning, and longitudinal modeling in biomedical NLP.`,

    abstract: `This study quantifies the association between non-adherence to antipsychotic medications and adverse outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia. We frame the problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of several adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail booking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner, nearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate individual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to medication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of longitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny County in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence advances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies confirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their removal amplifies the estimated effects. Subgroup analyses by medication formulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings highlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can yield policy-relevant insights.`,

    abstract: `The success of SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine has led to increased interest in the design and use of mRNA for vaccines and therapeutics. Still, selecting the most appropriate mRNA sequence for a protein remains a challenge. Several recent studies have shown that the specific mRNA sequence can have a significant impact on the translation efficiency, half-life, degradation rates, and other issues that play a major role in determining vaccine efficiency. To enable the selection of the most appropriate sequence, we developed mRNA-LM, an integrated small language model for modeling the entire mRNA sequence. mRNA-LM uses the contrastive language–image pretraining integration technology to combine three separate language models for the different mRNA segments. We trained mRNA-LM on millions of diverse mRNA sequences from several different species. The unsupervised model was able to learn meaningful biology related to evolution and host–pathogen interactions. Fine-tuning of mRNA-LM allowed us to use it in several mRNA property prediction tasks. As we show, using the full-length integrated model led to accurate predictions, improving on prior methods proposed for this task.`,

    abstract: `We consider the problem of predicting how the likelihood of an outcome of interest for a patient changes over time as we observe more of the patient's data. To solve this problem, we propose a supervised contrastive learning framework that learns an embedding representation for each time step of a patient time series. Our framework learns the embedding space to have the following properties: (1) nearby points in the embedding space have similar predicted class probabilities, (2) adjacent time steps of the same time series map to nearby points in the embedding space, and (3) time steps with very different raw feature vectors map to far apart regions of the embedding space. To achieve property (3), we employ a nearest neighbor pairing mechanism in the raw feature space. This mechanism also serves as an alternative to "data augmentation", a key ingredient of contrastive learning, which lacks a standard procedure that is adequately realistic for clinical tabular data, to our knowledge. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predicting mortality of septic patients (MIMIC-III dataset) and tracking progression of cognitive impairment (ADNI dataset).`,

These delays adversely affect patient experience and health outcomes, exacerbated by issues like the lack of post-discharge patient transportation and ineffective capacity management in the health system. Throughout the CMLH fellowship, we aimed to mitigate these issues by developing a discharge delay prediction module. This initiative was divided into two phases: (1) Length of Stay Prediction: Various regression models were benchmarked using prehospital data. (2) Predictability Analysis: Building on initial insights, the prediction task was refined based on length of stay percentiles. A key innovation in this study was the application of a contrastive learning approach.

Detailed studies of the microglial response after TBI require high throughput quantification of changes in microglial count and morphology in histological sections throughout the brain. In this paper, we present a fully automated end-to-end system that is capable of assessing microglial activation in white matter regions on whole slide images of Iba1 stained sections. Our approach involves the division of the full brain slides into smaller image patches that are subsequently automatically classified into white and grey matter sections. On the patches classified as white matter, we jointly apply functional minimization methods and deep learning classification to identify Iba1-immunopositive microglia. Detected cells are then automatically traced to preserve their complex branching structure after which fractal analysis is applied to determine the activation states of the cells. The resulting system detects white matter regions with 84% accuracy, detects microglia with a performance level of 0.70 (F1 score) and performs binary microglia morphology classification with a 70% accuracy.`,

    description: `Standard text-to-image pipelines return outputs even when all sampled candidates are visually poor or misaligned. We frame this problem as <em>selective generation</em>, where a system abstains from returning unreliable images. We propose a plug-and-play conformal abstention layer that wraps pretrained generators and human-preference reward models without retraining. This post hoc calibrator provides a distribution-free risk-control guarantee on the failure rate among accepted outputs. Evaluated on Pick-a-Pic prompts using SDXL-Turbo, conformal abstention achieves the highest selective accuracy and strongest empirical guarantees among baselines, demonstrating that post hoc calibration effectively makes generative systems reliability-aware.`,

    description: `Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great performance in few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) for a variety of generative and discriminative chemical design tasks. The newly expanded context windows of LLMs can further improve ICL capabilities for molecular inverse design and lead optimization. To take full advantage of these capabilities we developed a new semi-supervised learning method that overcomes the lack of experimental data available for many-shot ICL. Our approach involves iterative inclusion of LLM generated molecules with high predicted performance, along with experimental data. We further integrated our method in a multi-modal LLM which allows for the interactive modification of generated molecular structures using text instructions. As we show, the new method greatly improves upon existing ICL methods for molecular design while being accessible and easy to use for scientists.`,

//
// These are the cities pre-seeded on the globe before real visitor
// tracking began (May 2026).  They serve two purposes:

//   that the real data covers a city, remove its entry from this list
